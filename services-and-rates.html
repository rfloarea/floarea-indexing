          <p>
            A high quality index increases the value of your book, making it more useful to readers. After reading your entire book, I build a well-crafted back-of-the-book index that helps readers easily access the most important information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The cost of an index ranges from $3.75 to $7 per indexable page.</strong> The rate depends on the type of book, density and complexity of the material, length restrictions of the index, and the timeline of the project.
          </p>

        <div class="info-text proofreading">
          <h2 class="page-title">Proofreading</h2>
          <p>
            After your manuscript is laid-out, I closely read your entire book to catch any remaining spelling and typographical errors. I also look for any problems with typesetting specifications and page makeup.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The cost of proofreading ranges from 1¢ to 4¢ per word</strong>, in accordance with the EFA’s 
            <a href="https://www.the-efa.org/rates/" target="_blank">editorial rate survey</a>. The rate depends on the type of book and the timeline of the project.
          </p>

        <div class="info-text copyediting">
          <h2 class="page-title">Copyediting</h2>
          <p>
            Before your manuscript is laid-out, I provide a thorough copyedit of your book with a focus on clarity and consistency. During the copyediting process, I correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation; ensure consistency of style and usage; verify basic facts; and develop a style sheet specifically for your manuscript. If your book is fictional, I will pay close attention to consistency within the story, including character descriptions, plot points, and setting. The level of copyediting I provide depends on your project and needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The cost of copyediting ranges from 2¢ to 5¢ per word</strong>, in accordance with the EFA’s 
            <a href="https://www.the-efa.org/rates/" target="_blank">editorial rate survey</a>. The rate depends on the type of book, the level of copyediting needed, and the timeline of the project.

          <h2 class="page-title">Contact</h2>
          <p>
            If you would like to work with me or discuss my services, email me at <strong>floarea.indexing@startmail.com</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is normal for me to take 2 to 3 days to read my emails, reflect on the matter, and respond. As <a href="https://thenapministry.com/" >Tricia Hersey</a> says, "Exhaustion will not save us. Rest will."
          </p>
          <p>
            In alignment with my values, a portion of my income from book indexing is redistributed to mutual aid funds or grassroots organizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If you are self-publishing your book and are interested in my indexing services, I am open to a trade rather than a typical invoice. Please reach out! I'm especially excited about local honey, yarn, homemade jam, plants, and plant seeds, but we can figure it out together.</em>
