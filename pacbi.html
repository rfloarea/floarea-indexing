    <h2 class="page-title">Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel</h2>
    <section class="info">
      <div class="info-text">
        <p>I am committed to the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). You can learn more about PACBI on the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi">Boycott, Divesment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement</a> website and the <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/pacbi">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a> website.</p>
        <p>The guidelines for assessing whether events or products are in violation of the boycott are:</p>
        <ol class="pacbi-list">
          <li>
            As a general overriding rule, Israeli cultural institutions, unless proven otherwise, are complicit in maintaining the Israeli occupation and denial of basic Palestinian rights, whether through their silence or actual involvement in justifying, whitewashing or otherwise deliberately diverting attention from Israel's violations of international law and human rights. Accordingly, these institutions, all their products, and all the activities they sponsor or support must be boycotted by cultural organizations and cultural workers worldwide
          </li>
          <li>
            A cultural product is boycottable if it is commissioned by an official Israeli body or non-Israeli institution that serves Brand Israel or similar propaganda purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            A cultural event/activity is boycottable if it is partially or fully sponsored by an official Israeli body or a complicit institution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Normalization Projects are boycottable. "Any activity intended to suggest that Israel is a state like any other, that it is justified in its violence toward the Palestinian people, or that Palestinians, the oppressed, and Israel, the oppressor, are both equally responsible for “the conflict” are subject to a PACBI boycott." (<a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/pacbi">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Fact-finding missions and study tours that receive funding from Israel, its complicit institutions, or its international lobby groups are subject to the boycott.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As part of my commitment to PACBI:</p>
        <ul class="pacbi-list">
          <li>
            I will not index any books published by Israeli institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will not index any books commissioned by Israeli bodies or non-Israeli institutions that serve Brand Israel or otherwise engage in Israeli propaganda.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will not index books that engage in normalization.
          </li>
          <li>
            I prioritize working with publishing houses and presses that are committed to PACBI.
          </li>
        </ul>
