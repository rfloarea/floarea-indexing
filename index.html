          <h2>Hi! I'm Reed Floarea.</h2>
          <p>Reading was one of my first loves. As a kid, I would stay up late with a book under the covers long after I was supposed to be asleep. I'm still surprised that I got my BA in psychology, instead of literature.</p>
          <p>After a career in public health and behavioral health, I wanted to get back to my roots with books and started looking for options in the publishing industry. In August 2023, I completed my training in indexing through University of California, Berkeley Extension's <em>Indexing Theory and Application</em> course.</p>
          <p>I focus on back-of-the-book indexes for trade and academic books. I am especially interested in books on queer theory, disability justice, anarchism, abolition, labor movements, and liberation struggles. I prioritize working with publishing houses that are committed to the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). You can learn more about PACBI through the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi" >BDS movement</a> and <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/pacbi" >Writers Against the War on Gaza</a>.</p>
