              Reading was one of my first loves. As a kid, I would stay up late with a book under the covers long after I was supposed to be asleep. I'm still surprised that I got my BA in psychology instead of literature.
            </p>

              After a career in public health and behavioral health, I wanted to get back to my roots with books and started looking for options in the publishing industry. I chose indexing and completed my training through University of California, Berkeley Extension's Indexing Theory and Application course. A year later I expanded my skills to include proofreading and copyediting through Edit Republic's High-Level Proofreading and Copyediting Pro course.

              I provide back-of-the-book indexes, proofreading, and copyediting for trade and academic books. I am especially interested in books on queer theory, disability justice, anarchism, abolition, labor movements, and liberation struggles. I also love proofreading and copyediting fiction books, especially science fiction and fantasy.

              I prioritize working with publishing houses that are committed to the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). You can learn more about PACBI through <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi" target="_blank">BDS movement</a> and <a href="https://www.writersagainstthewarongaza.com/pacbi" target="_blank">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a>.

            <p>
              I live and work in Massachusetts' North Shore, the traditional and stolen land of the Massachusett tribe, the Pennacook people, the Pawtucket people, and the Agawam people.
